On our way create a transparent and tamper proof digital democratic elections

Our project is integrating Blockchain technology in our elections, but we have not
tampered with the polling machine with blockchain as we all know that blockchain networks
such as this that results in deciding the government is susceptible to 51% attacks.

Our idea provides integrity and transparency to other major aspects of our election.

We have implemnted two ideas,

CUTTING DOWN BOGuS VOTES
According to Sanjay Nirupam(Member of parliment,India) there are around 20,000 fake voters registered in every assembly seat in Mumbai, he even showed several fake voter IDs to the Media earlier this year. Our project in spite of the presence of fake voter IDs will cut down bogus voting.
Fake ID generation has become pretty easy nowadays but we know that every one of us has a unique fingerprint. Nowadays with every phone being equipped with fingerprint readers and also considering the easy availability of mobile computing power, we set up a private blockchain network that acts as a ledger that ID’s every person entering the based on their thumb impression and also their voter IDs for future reference. Even if a particular individual produces a fake ID they won’t be able to vote more than once as their thumb ID will be registered in the network and we can also keep a count of the voters in secure way as there are alleged issues of votes not being counted. With this the number of voters can be obtained and fake votes can also be cut down in tamper proof way. During the counting process the vote count can be matched to check and rectify any issues if present. 



TRANSPARENT FUNDING
On January 2, 2018, the government had notified the Electoral Bond Scheme. It was touted as an alternative to cash donations and to ensure transparency in political funding.Only political parties registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1951 and has secured no less than one per cent votes in the last Lok Sabha elections are eligible to receive electoral bonds.The electoral accounts are issued by the State Bank of India (SBI). The electoral bonds can be purchased in the months of January, April, July and October.Political parties are allotted a verified account by the Election Commission and all the electoral bond transactions are done through this account only. The donors can buy these electoral bonds and transfer them into the accounts of the political parties as a donation. The electoral bonds are available in denominations from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1 crore.The bonds remain valid for 15 days and can be encashed by an eligible political party only through a bank account with the authorised bank within that period only.Every donor has to provide his/her KYC details to the banks to purchase the electoral bonds. The names of the donors are kept confidential. Our project gives us a better clarity of this scheme and solves the alleged issues with the scheme.Some of the issues are, since the identity of the donor of electoral bonds has been kept anonymous, it could lead to an influx of black money. 

We provide each donor with unique tokens when they perform their KYC and we make sure that the tokens contain no PII so that it can't be linked back to them. The original identities of the donor shall only be known to the authorized personnel. The bond information will be entered in our blockchain ledger(private network). It can be viewed by the general public to provide transparency. The political parties expenditure and also the amount of bonds sold will also be entered and finally the numbers will be tallied to check for fraud. The unique tokens provided to donors will help us identify any influx of black money as the blockchain network will be available to all state Bank of India branches that sells the electoral bonds.
With the help of this project let us all take a step towards an honest and transparent democratic elections.
